	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. It's a way to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of how much time it takes to execute as the input size increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to execute, as a function of the input size. When an algorithm has a space complexity of 𝑂()
(
𝑛
)
O(n), it means the memory required grows linearly with the input size 
𝑛
n</p>
